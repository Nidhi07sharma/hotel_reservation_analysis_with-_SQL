# hotel_reservation_analysis_with-_SQL

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a hotel reservation dataset using SQL. The goal is to gain insights into guest preferences, booking trends, and key factors that impact hotel operations. This analysis helps in making informed decisions and enhancing the guest experience.

## Dataset Details
The dataset used for this analysis includes the following columns:
- **Booking_ID:** A unique identifier for each hotel reservation.
- **no_of_adults:** The number of adults in the reservation.
- **no_of_children:** The number of children in the reservation.
- **no_of_weekend_nights:** The number of nights in the reservation that fall on weekends.
- **no_of_week_nights:** The number of nights in the reservation that fall on weekdays.
- **type_of_meal_plan:** The meal plan chosen by the guests.
- **room_type_reserved:** The type of room reserved by the guests.
- **lead_time:** The number of days between booking and arrival.
- **arrival_date:** The date of arrival.
- **market_segment_type:** The market segment to which the reservation belongs.
- **avg_price_per_room:** The average price per room in the reservation.
- **booking_status:** The status of the booking.

## Analysis Questions
The following questions were answered using SQL queries to analyze the dataset:

1. What is the total number of reservations in the dataset?
2. Which meal plan is the most popular among guests?
3. What is the average price per room for reservations involving children?
4. How many reservations were made for the year 20XX?
5. What is the most commonly booked room type?
6. How many reservations fall on a weekend (no_of_weekend_nights > 0)?
7. What is the highest and lowest lead time for reservations?
8. What is the most common market segment type for reservations?
9. How many reservations have a booking status of "Confirmed"?
10. What is the total number of adults and children across all reservations?
11. What is the average number of weekend nights for reservations involving children?
12. How many reservations were made in each month of the year?
13. What is the average number of nights (both weekend and weekday) spent by guests for each room type?
14. For reservations involving children, what is the most common room type, and what is the average price for that room type?
15. Find the market segment type that generates the highest average price per room.

## SQL Queries
All SQL queries used to answer the analysis questions are included in the `hotel_reservation_analysis.sql` file. You can run this file in your MySQL environment to reproduce the analysis.
